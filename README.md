Below are some examples of the model at inference.  

Q - what is artificial intelligence technology?  
Ans - It is the ability to understand things, and the ability to see things.   
      There is no way to make it any better than we do, and we have to learn how to understand it.  
      We can't learn how to read and interpret it.  

Q - what is love?  
Ans - The idea is that if you want to love something, and your heart starts beating faster than  
      it normally would. That's the definition of "love."  

Q - what is love?  
Ans - I'm not sure if it's a literal definition of love, but the idea that we're all together  
      in one place or another is based on some sort of instinctual connection.

Q - what do you think about Europe?  
Ans - Europe is a continent, so the idea that Europe has an abundance of water (and other things)  
      and not just land seems to be false.  

Q - what is democracy?  
Ans - The term democracy is a bit misleading. It's not just the idea of government,  
      it's the concept that people can vote for things they don't like and decide what their  
      opinion on them should be based on whether or not you agree with your view of the world.

Q - which is the best country in the world?  
Ans - I don't think there's any way to know.  

Q - what is difference between animals and humans?  
Ans - Humans are generally considered to be the most intelligent species in the world,  
      and humans have been around for a long time. Humans were not born with this trait,  
      but they evolved it as an advantage over other animals.

Q - what is the meaning of emotion?  
Ans - It's a very complex phenomenon. For example, when you are talking about something   
      that is thought to be the result of an action, it makes sense for your brain to   
      interpret this as emotion.
